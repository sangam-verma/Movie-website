    <h1>Tallgirl</h1>
    <p> Jodi Kreyman is 16 and 6 ft 1+1⁄2 in (1.87 m) tall. She has been tall for her age since she was
        three, which has made her insecure her whole life. In contrast, Jodi's older sister Harper is of
        average height and a multiple beauty pageant winner. Dunkleman, a life-long friend,
        frequently asks her out, but she is reluctant, partly because he's much shorter than her.
        Stig Mohlin, a Swedish foreign exchange student, joins Jodi's class, and she is immediately
        interested. </p>
